# Custom layouts for Drupy theme.
#
# The main idea is to use Layout Builder along with Bootstrap 5 library loaded via npm in the theme,
# getting rid of additional libraries or modules like 'Bootstrap Layout Builder'.

# To get it working, we suggest you to also install 'Layout Builder Styles': https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_builder_styles
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------
#Â HOW TO CONFIGURE IT?
# ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Once installed and enabled, go to /admin/config/content/layout_builder_style/group
# and click on' Add layout builder style group'.
#   - Set 'Region container' as tag and 'region_container' as machine name.
#   - Enable 'User may only apply one style from this group per per section or block' checkbox.
#   - Save changes.
#
# Now, go to /admin/config/content/layout_builder_style and lick on 'Add layout builder style'
# and create a Booststrap container:
#   - Set 'Container' as tag, and 'container' as machine name.
#   - Set 'container' on the 'CSS classes' textarea.
#   - Enable 'Section' on the Type checkboxes section.
#   - Ensure the 'Group' is set to 'Region container' you created before.
#   - On 'Layout restrictions', enable this style for all the layouts defined in this file.
#   - Save changes.
#
# Repeat the above, now for a Container-fluid container:
#   - Set 'Container Fluid' as tag, and 'container_fluid' as machine name.
#   - Set 'container-fluid' on the 'CSS classes' textarea.
#   - Enable 'Section' on the Type checkboxes section.
#   - Ensure the 'Group' is set to 'Region container' you created before.
#   - On 'Layout restrictions', enable this style for all the layouts defined in this file.
#   - Save changes.
#
# Once the above is done, you'll find a new dropdown in the Layout Builder UI,
# letting you to select the 'Region container' you want to apply to a given section.
#
# At last, you'll want to define Bootstrap-based column classes to all the regions of your Layout Builder's section.
# Simply expand the 'Region attributes' and set you required Bootstrap on the 'Choose classes' fields.
# Drupy theme will automatically add the 'row' wrappers if they're required, based on your 'Region container' selection.
#
# Additionally, you might want to disable the default layouts that Layout Builder provides in its UI.
# See https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_disable for further information.
#
# This is a list of modules we suggest you to install, in order to improve your user experience using Layout Builder:
#
#   - Layout Builder Component Attributes:
#     https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_builder_component_attributes
#
#   - Layout Custom Section Classes & Attributes
#     https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_custom_section_classes
#
#   - Layout Builder Modal:
#     https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_builder_modal
#     Unforutnatelly, you'll might need to apply a patch along this module.
